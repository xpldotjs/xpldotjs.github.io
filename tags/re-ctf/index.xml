      <description>Challenge Info One of our team members developed a Flare-On challenge but accidentally deleted it. We recovered it using extreme digital forensic techniques but it seems to be corrupted. We would fix it but we are too busy solving today&amp;#39;s most important information security threats affecting our global economy. You should be able to get it working again, reverse engineer it, and acquire the flag. </description>
